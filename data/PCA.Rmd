# Data Exploration

This data set is vast and highly nuanced, in order to approach the analysis methodologically, we start by only considering the most simple variables. Our goal is to examine how the total chemical release varies both by location and by time, attempt to fit a model to this and then test the succe

#PCA
As PCA assumes that the data is normal, a histogram of the data is checked for normality. Here, we found that taking logarithm makes the dat almost normal. "Xylene (Mixed Isomers)" was one of the most common chemicals in the dataset. The distribution for this looks normal. 
```{r message=TRUE}
pca_df <- allRelevantData %>%
  select(YEAR, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, CHEMICAL, TOTAL_RELEASES) %>%
  filter(CHEMICAL == 'XYLENE (MIXED ISOMERS)') %>%
  mutate(id=1:n())%>%
  spread(YEAR, TOTAL_RELEASES) 
pca_df[is.na(pca_df)] <- 0
hist(log(pca_df$'2016'/mean(pca_df$'2016')))
```

```{r}
pca_df_meth <- allRelevantData %>%
  select(YEAR, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, CHEMICAL, TOTAL_RELEASES) %>%
  filter(CHEMICAL == 'METHANOL') %>%
  group_by(YEAR, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE) %>%  #Grouping by since some locations had multiple entries for methanol
  summarize(SUM_Releases = sum(TOTAL_RELEASES)) %>%
  spread(YEAR, SUM_Releases) %>%
  filter(LATITUDE != 0)
pca_df_meth[is.na(pca_df_meth)] <- 0
pca_df_meth[3:30] <- log(pca_df_meth[3:30] + 1)
hist(log(pca_df_meth$'2016'))#, breaks = 20)
```
Log-transformed methanol data is almost normally distributed and we can run PCA on this data.
