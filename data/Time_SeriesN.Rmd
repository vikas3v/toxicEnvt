# Analysis
Change in total chemical release by time
Change in amount of individual chemical releases by time
Change in chemical release type by time
Increase in shale gas output by time

## Plotting the total release of all chemicals over time
```{r}
total_release_time <- dat %>%
  select("year", "total_releases", "unit_of_measure") %>%
  filter(unit_of_measure == "Pounds") %>%    #dioxins measured in grams, excluding these
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(release_sum = sum(total_releases))


```

```{r}
ggplot(total_release_time, aes(x = year, y = release_sum)) +
  geom_point()
```
Analysis: Major outlier is financial crisis
Figure out when exactly shale gas revolution occurs
Why was it decreasing before the financial crisis
How much of the post 2009 increase is from returning to normal business and
